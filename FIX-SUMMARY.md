# üéØ Session Join 500 Error - ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED!

## The Problem
The 500 error was occurring on **GET** `/api/sessions/JGQQ7H/participants`, not the POST request we initially investigated.

## Root Cause
The GET endpoint for fetching participants was trying to use a **short code** (`JGQQ7H`) directly in a database query that expects a **UUID**. This caused a PostgreSQL error because `participants.sessionId` is a UUID column.

## The Fix
Updated the following endpoints to handle both UUIDs and short codes:

1. **GET** `/api/sessions/:sessionIdOrShortCode/participants` (lines 463-483)
   - Now resolves short codes to UUIDs before querying participants
   
2. **PATCH** `/api/sessions/:sessionIdOrShortCode/status` (lines 488-510)
   - Now resolves short codes to UUIDs before updating status
   
3. **PUT** `/api/sessions/:sessionIdOrShortCode/wine-selections` (lines 555-566)
   - Now resolves short codes to UUIDs before updating selections

4. Removed duplicate participants endpoint (line 722)

## How It Works Now
```javascript
// Before: Direct query with short code fails
const participants = await storage.getParticipantsBySessionId("JGQQ7H"); // ‚ùå Fails

// After: Resolve to UUID first
const session = await storage.getSessionById("JGQQ7H"); // ‚úÖ Returns session with UUID
const participants = await storage.getParticipantsBySessionId(session.id); // ‚úÖ Works
```

## Why This Happened
- The POST endpoint for joining was already fixed (see "CRITICAL FIX" comment)
- But the GET endpoints were missed and still had the bug
- The error occurs when components poll for participant updates using short codes

## Testing
The fix ensures all session-related endpoints consistently:
1. Accept both UUIDs and short codes
2. Use `getSessionById()` to resolve to actual UUID
3. Use the UUID for all database operations

This should completely resolve the 500 error!
