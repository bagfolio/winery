# 🎯 EXECUTION PROGRESS - Template System Overhaul

## 🎪 OBJECTIVE
Fix ALL template types (multiple choice, scale/slider, text) so they work properly in:
1. **PackageEditor** - Show correct forms for editing
2. **TastingSession** - Render properly for participants  
3. **Database** - Save with correct payload structure

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS: ANALYSIS PHASE

### ✅ COMPLETED
- Initial problem identification
- Created comprehensive todo tracking system

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS  
- **Deep verification analysis** of ALL template types and user flow

---

## 🔍 VERIFICATION ANALYSIS

### Template Types to Fix:
1. **Scale/Slider Questions**: acidity-level, tannin-level, aroma-intensity, overall-impression
2. **Multiple Choice Questions**: body-assessment, finish-length, visual-assessment  
3. **Text Input Questions**: tasting-notes

### Issues Found So Far:
- **Property naming mismatches** between templates and components
- **Missing required fields** in template payloads
- **Inconsistent structure** across template types

---

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### For Each Template Type:
1. **Create slide** from template in PackageEditor
2. **Verify editor form** shows all expected fields
3. **Save slide** and check database payload_json
4. **Test in TastingSession** - verify participant experience
5. **Document results** in this file

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Editor shows complete form for each template type
- ✅ Participant view renders interactive question
- ✅ Database has correct payload structure
- ✅ Som dashboard can edit all question types

---

## 📝 DETAILED NOTES

### Analysis Starting: [TIMESTAMP WILL BE ADDED]

**Next Steps:**
1. Analyze ALL template payload structures in wineTemplates.ts
2. Compare with component expectations in SlideEditor.tsx
3. Identify ALL mismatches and missing fields
4. Create comprehensive fix plan
5. Execute fixes with testing after each change

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS - UPDATE FROM TESTING

### ❌ ACTUAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED!
From user testing and database inspection, the real issue is **NOT the templates** but **the slide creation logic**:

**Database Evidence:**
```json
// What's actually getting saved to Supabase:
{"title": "Body Assessment", "description": ""}

// What SHOULD be getting saved:
{
  "questionType": "multiple_choice",
  "question": "How would you describe the body or weight of this wine?",
  "description": "Think about how the wine feels in your mouth...",
  "options": [...],
  "allowMultiple": false,
  "timeLimit": 30,
  "points": 15
}
```

### 🎯 ROOT CAUSE: `addSlideFromTemplate` Function Issue
The function is **NOT copying the complete `payloadTemplate`** from our updated templates! Instead it's creating a minimal payload with only title/description.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS (ORIGINAL)

### ✅ GOOD NEWS: Templates are mostly CORRECT!
After deep analysis, the templates in `wineTemplates.ts` are actually using the **correct property names**:
- ✅ `questionType` (camelCase) - CORRECT
- ✅ `scaleMin`, `scaleMax` (camelCase) - CORRECT  
- ✅ `scaleLabels` (array format) - CORRECT
- ✅ `options` (array format) - CORRECT

### ❌ MISSING CRITICAL FIELDS
However, ALL templates are missing **required fields** that the editor and participant view expect:

#### For ALL Question Types:
- ❌ `question` - The actual question text (editor expects this at payload.question)
- ❌ `description` - Question subtitle/instructions  
- ❌ `timeLimit` - How long users have to answer
- ❌ `points` - Point value for scoring

#### For Multiple Choice:
- ❌ `allowMultiple` - Whether multiple selections allowed
- ❌ Option `id` fields - Each option needs unique ID
- ❌ Option `description` fields - For detailed option explanations

#### For Text Questions:
- ❌ `maxLength` - Character limit
- ❌ Complete structure

### 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
Templates have correct property naming but are **incomplete structures**. This causes:
1. **Editor forms show empty** because `payload.question` is undefined
2. **Participant questions don't render** because required fields missing
3. **Database saves incomplete payloads** that can't be properly rendered

## 🔄 NEXT ACTIONS

### ✅ PHASE 1: COMPLETED - Template Structures Fixed!
1. ✅ **visual-assessment**: Added question, description, allowMultiple, option IDs & descriptions  
2. ✅ **aroma-intensity**: Added question, description, timeLimit (45s), points (15)
3. ✅ **tasting-notes**: Added question, description, maxLength (500), timeLimit (60s), points (20) 
4. ✅ **body-assessment**: Added question, description, allowMultiple, option IDs & descriptions
5. ✅ **tannin-level**: Added question, description, timeLimit (40s), points (15)
6. ✅ **acidity-level**: Added question, description, timeLimit (35s), points (15) 
7. ✅ **finish-length**: Added question, description, allowMultiple, option IDs & descriptions
8. ✅ **overall-impression**: Added question, description, timeLimit (30s), points (25)

### 🔄 PHASE 2: IN PROGRESS - Comprehensive Testing
#### Testing Strategy:
1. ✅ **Start dev server** - Running on port 5001, no TypeScript errors
2. 🔄 **Active Testing Detected** - Someone is testing PackageEditor (GET /api/slide-templates successful)
3. 🔄 **TastingSession Active** - Participant testing in progress (participant ID: 9aac7cbc...)
4. ⏳ **Verify editor forms** - Check if all template fields appear correctly
5. ⏳ **Check database** - Verify payload_json structure in Supabase

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Editor shows complete forms (question text, options, scale settings, etc.)
- ✅ All templates save correctly to database  
- ✅ Participants see interactive questions in TastingSession
- ✅ All question types work end-to-end

### 🎯 PHASE 3: Verify Complete Flow
1. ⏳ Som dashboard can create ALL question types
2. ⏳ Multiple choice, scale, and text questions work in live sessions
3. ⏳ Database integrity maintained throughout
