# ðŸŽ¯ SECTION TRANSITION EXECUTION PLAN

## ðŸš¨ IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSES

### 1. **Section Assignment Math Error**
- `Math.floor(8 * 0.4) = 3` for both intro and deep dive
- Creates: Intro (3 slides), Deep Dive (3 slides), Ending (2 slides)
- This is actually CORRECT - no overlap issue

### 2. **Package Intro Slide Confusion**
- Package welcome slide gets extracted from first wine
- Reduces first wine from 8 slides to 7 slides  
- This breaks our section math: 7 slides â†’ Intro (2), Deep Dive (2), Ending (3)

### 3. **Section Detection Logic Mismatch**
- `isLastSlideOfSection` function may not be finding correct boundaries
- Transition logic requires perfect coordination between section assignment and detection

## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION STEPS

### STEP 1: Fix Package Intro Extraction
Current logic extracts package intro incorrectly, breaking wine slide counts.

### STEP 2: Verify Section Boundary Calculation  
Ensure all slides get proper computed sections assigned.

### STEP 3: Debug Section Detection Function
Fix `isLastSlideOfSection` to work with computed sections.

### STEP 4: Add Transition Trigger Verification
Ensure transitions trigger at exact section boundaries.

### STEP 5: Test Complete Flow
Verify introâ†’deep diveâ†’ending transitions work consistently.

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

1. **Package Intro Logic**: Don't extract from wine slides, handle separately
2. **Section Math**: Ensure consistent slide counts for accurate percentages  
3. **Transition Detection**: Use computed sections consistently
4. **Debug Logging**: Track exact slide assignments and transition triggers

**Expected Result**: Smooth section transitions at every section boundary with 2.5-3 second animations.
