# Package Editor Testing Guide

## ✅ Implemented Fixes

### 1. State Management Fixed
- **Issue**: Slides were reverting after reordering due to useEffect overwriting local changes
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `dataLoadedRef` to track initial load
  - Only sync from server on initial mount
  - Local state (`localSlides`) is now the source of truth for UI

### 2. Database Constraint Handling
- **Issue**: 500 errors when reordering due to unique position constraint
- **Fix**: 
  - Server now uses temporary negative positions during swap
  - Two-pass update prevents constraint violations
  - Better error messages

### 3. Save Workflow
- **Issue**: Changes were being saved immediately, causing conflicts
- **Fix**: 
  - Added prominent "Save Slide Order" button with animation
  - Keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + S
  - Visual indicators for unsaved changes
  - Toast notifications for user feedback

### 4. Welcome Slides
- **Issue**: Welcome slides not appearing at top
- **Fix**: 
  - Welcome slides created at position 0
  - Special visual styling with badge
  - Cannot be moved below first position
  - Cannot be deleted if only one exists

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Slide Reordering
1. Open Package Editor
2. Expand a wine section
3. Click the up/down arrows to reorder slides
4. **Expected**: 
   - Slides move immediately in UI
   - "Save Slide Order" button appears with pulsing animation
   - Slides have amber border indicating unsaved state
   - Toast shows "Click 'Save Order' to persist your changes"

### Test 2: Save Functionality
1. After reordering slides, click "Save Slide Order"
2. **Expected**:
   - Button shows loading spinner
   - Success toast appears
   - Amber borders disappear
   - Save button disappears
3. Refresh page - order should persist

### Test 3: Keyboard Shortcut
1. Reorder some slides
2. Press Cmd+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows)
3. **Expected**: Same as clicking save button

### Test 4: Welcome Slide Protection
1. Try to move welcome slide down
2. **Expected**: Error toast "Cannot move welcome slide"
3. Try to delete welcome slide (if only one)
4. **Expected**: Error toast "Cannot delete welcome slide"

### Test 5: Multiple Changes
1. Reorder multiple slides across different sections
2. Check sidebar banner shows correct count
3. Save all changes at once
4. **Expected**: All positions saved correctly

### Test 6: Error Handling
1. Disconnect internet
2. Try to save slide order
3. **Expected**: Error toast with clear message

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Unsaved Changes:
- **Save Button**: Bright amber/orange gradient with pulse animation
- **Badge**: Red "Unsaved" badge bouncing
- **Sidebar Banner**: Amber warning with change count
- **Slide Borders**: Amber highlight on all slides

### Welcome Slides:
- **Icon**: Sparkles icon
- **Badge**: "Welcome" badge in amber
- **Border**: Special amber gradient
- **Position**: Always first in intro section

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

1. **No More Reverting**: Local state management prevents UI flickering
2. **Batch Updates**: All position changes saved in one request
3. **Optimistic UI**: Changes appear instantly
4. **Smart Positioning**: Uses gaps (10, 20, 30) for future insertions

## 📝 Notes

- The fix uses a two-phase approach: local updates for UI, server sync on save
- Database positions use gaps to minimize future conflicts
- Welcome slides have special `is_welcome` flag for consistent identification
- All mutations now properly reset the data loaded flag
