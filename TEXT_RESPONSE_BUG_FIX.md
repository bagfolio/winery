# Text Response Slide Bug Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
Users experienced a critical bug where typing in a text response slide and then navigating would cause subsequent slides to fail to render. The slides would load in memory but not display on screen.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Async Race Condition**
- Text input triggered immediate state updates and async save operations
- Navigation could occur while saves were in progress
- Component unmounting interrupted async operations

### 2. **AnimatePresence Key Issues**
- Using `currentSlide?.id || currentSlideIndex` as key caused fallback issues
- When slides failed to load, React preserved stale component instances
- This prevented proper remounting of new slide components

### 3. **Uncontrolled Async Operations**
- `saveResponse` performed IndexedDB and API operations without proper await handling
- Navigation timeouts fired regardless of pending operations
- No safeguards prevented navigation during active saves

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. **Async-Safe Navigation**
- Made `handleAnswerChange` async and properly await `saveResponse`
- Added `isSaving` state to track active save operations
- Modified all navigation functions to check `isSaving` before proceeding
- Updated UI to show "Saving..." state and disable navigation buttons

### 2. **Fixed AnimatePresence Keys**
- Changed key to compound format: `slide-${currentSlide?.id}-${currentSlideIndex}`
- Ensures unique keys even when slide data is temporarily unavailable
- Forces proper unmounting/remounting of components

### 3. **Debounced Input**
- Added `useDebounce` hook with 300ms delay
- Reduces frequency of save operations during rapid typing
- Prevents overwhelming the system with state updates

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the flow
- Non-throwing error handling in `saveResponse`
- Lifecycle logging in TextQuestion component

## Code Changes

### `/client/src/hooks/useSessionPersistence.ts`
- Made `saveResponse` return `Promise<void>`
- Added error handling that doesn't throw
- Improved logging for debugging

### `/client/src/pages/TastingSession.tsx`
- Added `isSaving` state
- Made `handleAnswerChange` async
- Added save guards to all navigation functions
- Fixed AnimatePresence key
- Added UI feedback for saving state

### `/client/src/components/questions/TextQuestion.tsx`
- Added debounced onChange handler
- Added lifecycle logging
- Improved state management

### `/client/src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`
- New utility hook for debouncing values

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to a text response slide
2. Type rapidly and immediately click Next
3. Verify the next slide renders correctly
4. Test with slow network (throttle to 3G)
5. Test offline mode
6. Test rapid navigation between slides

## Remaining Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- Consider implementing request cancellation for in-flight saves
- Add request deduplication for identical answers
- Optimize IndexedDB operations

### UX Improvements
- Add visual feedback when saves are pending
- Consider auto-save indicators
- Add unsaved changes warnings

### Error Recovery
- Implement retry logic for failed saves
- Add user notification for sync failures
- Consider background sync for offline responses

## Debug Commands
To monitor the fix in action, open browser console and look for:
- `[TextResponse Debug]` - Component lifecycle and state changes
- `[TextQuestion Debug]` - Input handling and mounting/unmounting
- Navigation and section transition logs

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ Text input no longer blocks subsequent slides
- ✅ Navigation is prevented during active saves
- ✅ Proper component unmounting/remounting
- ✅ Debounced input reduces save frequency
- ✅ UI shows saving state
- ✅ Works in offline mode
- ✅ No console errors during normal operation
