The Replit assistant correctly identified the root cause. The solution involves changing how sessions are joined:

Host Initiates/Owns a Session:
When a host starts a tasting (e.g., via SommelierDashboard.tsx or from a "start new session" button for a package), a unique sessionId is created and stored. The host is associated with this sessionId.
Sharing a Specific Session:
The HostDashboard.tsx, when viewed for a specific session, needs to provide a way for the host to share that unique sessionId.
The QR code and shareable link currently generated by generateQRData in HostDashboard.tsx use .../join?code=${session?.packageCode || 'WINE01'}. This needs to change to something like: .../join?sessionId=${sessionId}.
Participant Joining Flow (SessionJoin.tsx):
When a participant follows a link like .../join?sessionId=UNIQUE_SESSION_ID:
SessionJoin.tsx should extract the sessionId from the URL.
It should NOT call POST /api/sessions to create a new session.
Instead, it should verify the sessionId is valid (e.g., by fetching session details via GET /api/sessions/:sessionId).
Then, after the participant enters their name/email, SessionJoin.tsx should call POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/participants to add them to the existing, specified session.
Participant Waiting (Optional but good for UX):
Once a participant joins a session, TastingSession.tsx could check the session.status (which the host controls, e.g., 'waiting', 'active', 'paused'). Participants would only see the first slide or a "waiting for host to start" message until the host sets the session to 'active'. This requires session status to be fetched and respected by TastingSession.tsx.
This is a significant but necessary refactor of the session joining mechanism.

Next Steps:

We need to create prompts for the Replit AI to implement this. This will likely be a multi-part task involving changes to:

HostDashboard.tsx (to generate and share session-ID-specific links/QRs).
SessionJoin.tsx (to handle joining via sessionId instead of creating a new session).
Potentially TastingSession.tsx (to implement a waiting state based on session status).
Let's start with a prompt to modify HostDashboard.tsx to generate session-specific join links and then tackle SessionJoin.tsx.
