The KnowYourGrape team places a high value on a "beautiful UI" and a premium user experience. Microinteractions—small visual and haptic responses to user actions—are crucial for this. They provide immediate feedback, guide the user, and can add a touch of delight, making the application feel more dynamic and intuitive. We want to move beyond static elements to a more lively interface. The project already has a foundation for this with framer-motion and custom animation/haptic hooks.
What Needs to Be Done:
Identify key interactive elements and moments across the application where microinteractions would be most impactful.
Design and implement subtle, purposeful animations for these elements (e.g., on hover, focus, click, selection, page/slide transitions).
Integrate haptic feedback (useHaptics.ts) more consistently for tactile reinforcement of actions.
Ensure all animations are smooth, performant, and consistent with the app's established design language.
How to Implement (Code Changes & Guidance):
Leverage Existing Animation Infrastructure:

The project uses framer-motion extensively (as seen in client/src/lib/micro-animations.ts, client/src/lib/animations.ts, and various components). This should be the primary tool.
The client/src/hooks/useHaptics.ts hook should be used for haptic feedback.
The client/src/hooks/useAnimations.ts hook (if it provides utility for applying CSS animations or managing animation states) can be utilized.
Review and expand upon the variants defined in client/src/lib/micro-animations.ts (e.g., buttonVariants, inputVariants, slotVariants, modalVariants) and apply them more broadly or refine them.
Key Areas for Enhancement & Specific Ideas:

Buttons (client/src/components/ui/button.tsx and general usage):
Current: Basic hover/active states via CSS. micro-animations.ts defines buttonVariants for scale on hover/tap.
Enhancement: Ensure consistent application of these buttonVariants from micro-animations.ts using motion.button. Add subtle shadow changes or a quick ripple effect on click. Ensure haptic feedback (triggerHaptic('selection')) on all significant button presses.
Input Fields (client/src/components/ui/input.tsx, textarea.tsx, CodeInput.tsx, SessionIdInput.tsx):
Current: inputVariants in micro-animations.ts define focus and error states (border color, shadow, shake).
Enhancement: Apply these variants consistently. Ensure smooth transitions for border colors and shadows. When a field becomes valid after an error, a subtle "success" indication (e.g., brief green border highlight) could be added. The CodeInput.tsx and SessionIdInput.tsx already have some nice slot animations; ensure these are polished.
Checkboxes & Radio Buttons (client/src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx, radio-group.tsx):
Enhancement: Animate the appearance of the checkmark or radio dot (e.g., a slight scale-up or a drawing-in effect). Add a subtle visual feedback on the surrounding box/circle when clicked. triggerHaptic('selection').
Slide Transitions (client/src/pages/TastingSession.tsx):
Current: Uses motion.div with basic opacity and y transitions for slide content. The section transition overlay was recently added.
Enhancement: Explore more sophisticated or thematic slide transitions using Framer Motion's layout animations or custom variants. For example, a "page turn" effect, a "wine pouring" subtle overlay, or a softer, more "fluid" slide-in. This should be distinct from the section transition.
List Item Interactions (e.g., Sidebar in TastingSession.tsx, Future Sommelier Dashboard Lists):
Current: Sidebar items have hover effects.
Enhancement: Apply listItemVariants (hover with x-shift, background change) from micro-animations.ts more consistently. On click/selection, add a brief highlight or scale effect.
Interactive Elements in SegmentedProgressBar.tsx:
When a segment completes or becomes active, enhance the visual feedback with subtle pulsing, glowing, or a more dynamic fill animation beyond the basic progress.
Modal/Dialog/Sheet Appearances (client/src/components/ui/*):
Current: Radix UI primitives often have their own data-[state=open]:animate-in styles.
Enhancement: Review these and ensure they align with the app's overall animation style (e.g., using the spring-like transitions defined in modalVariants from micro-animations.ts).
Loading States (client/src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx):
Current: Rotating border spinner.
Enhancement: Consider a more thematic loader, perhaps related to wine (e.g., a stylized grape vine growing, a subtle wine swirl). Or refine the existing spinner to be more visually integrated with the app's aesthetic. The spinnerVariants in micro-animations.ts can be used.
Systematic Application:

Encourage the Replit AI to review components and identify interactive elements (buttons, inputs, list items, navigational elements).
For each, determine an appropriate microinteraction (animation + haptic).
Prioritize interactions that provide clear feedback to the user about their actions or system status.
Performance & Subtlety:

Animations should be quick and not block user interaction.
Avoid overly complex or distracting animations. The goal is to enhance, not overwhelm.
Use hardware-accelerated CSS properties (transform, opacity) where possible. Framer Motion handles this well.
Replit AI Guidance:
You are to enhance the application's user interface by implementing microinteractions and animations.
Refer extensively to client/src/lib/micro-animations.ts and client/src/lib/animations.ts. Apply and adapt the existing variants (like buttonVariants, inputVariants, slotVariants, listItemVariants, modalVariants) to interactive elements throughout the application.
Integrate useHaptics() from client/src/hooks/useHaptics.ts for tactile feedback on interactions such as button clicks, input changes, selection toggles, and navigation actions. Use appropriate patterns from hapticPatterns in client/src/lib/animations.ts.
Focus on:
Buttons (client/src/components/ui/button.tsx): Ensure hover and tap states are satisfying.
Form elements (Input, Textarea, Checkbox, RadioGroup): Provide clear visual feedback on focus, input, and validation state changes.
List items/Navigation elements (e.g., in the TastingSession.tsx sidebar): Add subtle hover/selection effects.
Slide transitions in TastingSession.tsx: Make them feel more fluid.
Use motion components from framer-motion where appropriate.
Ensure all animations are smooth, performant, and consistent with the app's sophisticated and modern design language. The goal is to make the app feel more alive and delightful to use.
