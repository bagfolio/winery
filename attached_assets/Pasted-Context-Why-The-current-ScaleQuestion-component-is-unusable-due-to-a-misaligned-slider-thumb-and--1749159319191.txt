Context & Why:
The current ScaleQuestion component is unusable due to a misaligned slider thumb and contains cluttered, redundant text. It fails to provide the user with a sense of what their rating means, which is a core requirement. We need to overhaul it to be visually correct, clean, and provide an engaging, intuitive experience where the UI itself communicates the meaning of the user's selection through ambient color and dynamic text.

What Needs to Be Done:

Fix the CSS positioning of the slider thumb so it sits correctly on the track.
Remove all redundant min/max labels, leaving only one clean set.
Implement a dynamic, single-word or short-phrase text descriptor above the slider that updates as the user slides.
Enhance the slider track with a "hot spot" or "energy glow" that follows the thumb and intensifies at higher values.
How to Implement (Code Changes & Guidance):

Step 1: Fix the Slider Thumb Positioning & Clean Up Labels (CRITICAL BUG FIX):

File: client/src/components/ui/modern-slider.tsx or client/src/components/questions/ScaleQuestion.tsx. The bug is likely in the style={{ left:${percentage}%}} calculation combined with translate-y-1/2 -translate-x-1/2. The AI must ensure the parent container is relative and the thumb is absolute within it, and that no other layout rule is pushing it down. The thumb's top should be 50%, and the translateY should be -50% to perfectly center it.
File: client/src/components/questions/ScaleQuestion.tsx.
Action: Delete all but one set of the "Very Light" and "Very Intense" labels. Keep the set below the visual dash marks for clarity. The layout should be: Title -> Description -> [NEW DYNAMIC DESCRIPTOR] -> Slider Track -> Min/Max Labels.
Step 2: Implement the Dynamic Text Descriptor (The Core Feedback):

Action: This directly addresses your request to show "what you're actually saying". We will use the feedback_tiers data we previously defined in the payloadJson.
File: client/src/components/questions/ScaleQuestion.tsx.
Logic: Inside the component, use the React.useMemo hook to find the appropriate descriptive text for the current value.
TypeScript

const feedbackText = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (!question.payloadJson.feedback_tiers) return ' '; // Return a non-breaking space to maintain height
  const tier = question.payloadJson.feedback_tiers.find(t => value <= t.lte);
  return tier ? tier.text : ' '; 
}, [value, question.payloadJson.feedback_tiers]);
JSX: Add a new motion.p element above the slider to display this text. Use AnimatePresence and a key to make the text gracefully fade and cross-dissolve when it changes.
TypeScript

// Add this div ABOVE the <ModernSlider /> component
<div className="h-6 text-center mb-2"> {/* Container to prevent layout jumps */}
  <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
    <motion.p
      key={feedbackText} // CRITICAL: This makes it re-animate on text change
      className="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-300"
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 5 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -5 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
    >
      {feedbackText}
    </motion.p>
  </AnimatePresence>
</div>
Step 3: Implement the "Energy Glow" on the Slider Track:

File: client/src/components/ui/modern-slider.tsx.
Action: We will add a new motion.div inside the slider track that acts as a moving "hotspot" of light.
JSX (modern-slider.tsx):
TypeScript

// Inside the main track motion.div
<motion.div
  ref={trackRef}
  className="relative h-3 bg-white/10 rounded-full ..."
  //...
>
  {/* ... progress fill div ... */}

  {/* NEW: Hotspot Glow Element */}
  <motion.div
    className="absolute top-1/2 w-8 h-8 rounded-full pointer-events-none -translate-y-1/2 -translate-x-1/2"
    style={{ 
      background: 'radial-gradient(circle, rgba(233, 168, 255, 0.5) 0%, rgba(192, 132, 252, 0) 65%)' 
    }}
    animate={{ 
      left: `${percentage}%`,
      scale: 1 + (percentage / 100) * 0.5 // Glow gets bigger at higher values
    }}
    transition={{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 300, damping: 20 }}
  />

  {/* ... dash marks ... */}
</motion.div>
Replit AI Guidance:
Fix the Bug First: The absolute priority is to correct the CSS for the slider thumb in modern-slider.tsx so it is perfectly centered on and aligned with the track.
Declutter the UI: In ScaleQuestion.tsx, remove the redundant labels and the entire Collapsible info panel at the bottom.
Implement the Dynamic Descriptor Text: Add the AnimatePresence block above the slider to display the live feedback text from feedback_tiers. Ensure it animates smoothly as the slider value changes.
Implement the Visual Glow: Add the "hotspot glow" element to the ModernSlider component. Its position should be locked to the slider's percentage, and its scale and/or opacity should increase with the value to provide that ambient, visual feedback.
The final product must be clean, visually correct, and provide immediate, elegant feedback to the user's action, fulfilling the vision of a "Living Slider".
