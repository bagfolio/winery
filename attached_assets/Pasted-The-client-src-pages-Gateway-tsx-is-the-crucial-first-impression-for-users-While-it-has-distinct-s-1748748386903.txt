The client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx is the crucial first impression for users. While it has distinct 'selection', 'join', and 'host' modes, the current UI needs significant refinement to achieve the desired "premium, modern, engaging, and beautiful" feel, especially for mobile users.

Key issues to address:

Layout & Spacing: When switching from the initial 'selection' mode to the 'join' or 'host' input modes, the main "KnowYourGrape" header section remains, leading to awkward vertical spacing and a less focused experience for code entry (as seen in image_541113.png). The overall page can feel "uncentered" or "disjointed."
Header Element Sizing: The "KnowYourGrape" title and logo currently change size when the userMode changes; this should be made consistent when the header is visible.
Aesthetics: We need to elevate the overall visual polish.
Objective (What):
Radically improve the UI and UX of client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx by:

Implementing a "focused view" system: When userMode is 'join' or 'host', the main "KnowYourGrape" header section (logo, title, subtitle) must be hidden. Only the specific input form for that mode (including its own title like "Join Session" and a "Back" button) should be visible, occupying the screen effectively and being well-centered.
When userMode === 'selection', the main "KnowYourGrape" header and the two selection cards ("Join Session," "Host Session") must be displayed with improved visual balance, consistent sizing for header elements, and generous, well-considered spacing.
Enhance the overall modern aesthetics using glassmorphism, refined typography, and ensuring the color palette is used effectively for a premium feel.
Ensure all changes are mobile-first and maintain or improve responsiveness.
Confirm the QR code scanning option remains removed from the "Host a New Tasting" UI path.
Implementation Details (How):

Conditional Rendering for Main Header & Focused Views:

Modify Gateway.tsx (around lines 95-122 and the AnimatePresence block):
The entire "Enhanced Animated Logo" motion.div (containing the Wine icon, "KnowYourGrape" h1, and "Premium Wine Tasting Experience" p) should only render if userMode === 'selection'. Use <AnimatePresence> if you want it to animate in/out, or simply conditionally render it.
When userMode is 'join' or 'host', this main header block should not be present in the DOM.
The content for the 'join' mode (currently lines 185-241) and 'host' mode (currently lines 243-299) should then become the primary content on the screen. Ensure these views (including their own "Back" button and title like "Join Session") are vertically and horizontally centered effectively to provide a focused experience. Adjust the main flex container (div around line 92) or add new wrappers as needed to achieve this focused centering for the 'join' and 'host' states.
Consistent Header Sizing (for 'selection' mode):
Remove the dynamic font/icon sizing based on userMode for the main "KnowYourGrape" title, subtitle, and Wine icon (lines 106-122). Select a single, impactful set of sizes for these elements that looks good for the initial 'selection' view.
Improve Layout, Spacing, and Centering:

Selection Mode: When the main header and the two selection cards are visible, ensure they are presented with balanced vertical spacing. Re-evaluate the mb-12 md:mb-20 on the header and the space-y-8 for the cards to create a more harmonious composition. Consider the overall vertical centering of this entire group.
Join/Host Modes (Focused Views):
Once the main header is hidden, the form for 'join' (Back button, "Join Session" title, SessionIdInput, buttons) should be a self-contained unit, centered effectively on the screen. The same applies to the 'host' form.
Review and refine padding and margins within these forms (e.g., space-y-8 for the outer motion.div, then space-y-6 md:space-y-8 for the card content) to ensure elements have adequate "breathing room" and a clean visual hierarchy.
Ensure the "Back" button and mode title (e.g., "Join Session") are well-positioned and visually balanced within these focused views.
Aesthetic Enhancements (Continue and Refine):

Glassmorphism: Continue using the bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-xl rounded-3xl p-8 border border-white/20 shadow-2xl style for card elements, ensuring it looks polished.
Typography: The prompt for Task 17 mentioned selecting more elegant fonts. If specific fonts were not chosen by the AI previously, instruct it to select and implement a clear, elegant, and mobile-friendly font pairing (e.g., a sophisticated sans-serif for headings and UI text). Ensure consistent application.
Color Palette: Leverage the existing dark purple gradient. Introduce subtle warm accents (e.g., gold, champagne, or the existing amber/orange from the "Host Session" icon background) for key interactive elements like primary buttons, ensuring high contrast and a premium feel.
Micro-interactions: Enhance existing Framer Motion animations for transitions between modes and for button/card hovers to be smooth and delightful.
