Context & Why:
The client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx has been updated to have distinct modes ('selection', 'join', 'host') and a conditional main header. However, there are remaining UI/UX issues:

Animation Stutter: The Framer Motion transition when the main "KnowYourGrape" header hides (as userMode changes from 'selection' to 'join'/'host') feels stuttered, not smooth.
Spacing & Centering - Selection Mode: In the initial 'selection' mode (see image_51d5f7.png), the main "KnowYourGrape" title/logo section feels too close ("glued") to the "Join Session" and "Host Session" cards below it, or the whole group isn't optimally centered vertically for all screen heights.
Spacing & Centering - Join/Host Modes: In the 'join' and 'host' modes (see image_51d5bd.png for 'join' mode), the mode-specific title (e.g., "Join Session") and "Back" button can feel cramped at the top of their card, and the overall card needs to be perfectly centered and have good internal "breathing room."
The goal is a highly polished, mobile-first interface with smooth transitions and a balanced, professional layout.

Objective (What):

Optimize Framer Motion transitions in Gateway.tsx to ensure the main header hides smoothly and quickly when switching userMode.
Refine the vertical spacing and layout for all three userModes to achieve better visual balance, eliminate "cramped" or "glued" feelings, and ensure content is appropriately centered, especially for mobile.
Ensure consistent, high-quality styling for input components and buttons within these views.
Implementation Details (How):

Smooth Header Transition:

Analyze Animations: Review the AnimatePresence and motion.div elements for the main header (lines 96-124) and the 'join'/'host' mode views (e.g., lines 187-192, 245-249).
Simplify if Needed: The exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -30 }} for the header and initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 50 }} / exit={{ opacity: 0, x: -50 }} (or scale: 0.95) for the content views are reasonable. Ensure the transition={{ duration: 0.6 }} (or similar) values are not too long and that the mode="wait" on AnimatePresence is appropriate for the desired effect (it waits for the exiting element to finish before the new one enters).
Performance: Consider if the continuous background animations (animations.float) or the logo's complex boxShadow animation are impacting transition performance. Temporarily disabling them during transitions or simplifying them could be tested. For now, focus on the enter/exit transitions of the main content blocks.
Refine Layout and Spacing for All Modes:

Overall Vertical Centering (Main div at line 92):
It currently uses justify-center. If the content height changes significantly between userModes (especially now that the header disappears), this can cause vertical shifts.
Consider This Structure:
HTML

<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-primary ... flex flex-col px-4 py-8 ...">
  {/* Optional: A small, always-visible top bar for a back button if not in 'selection' mode, or for a tiny logo */}

  <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
    {userMode === 'selection' && (
      <motion.div key="selection" className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center flex-grow w-full max-w-lg space-y-8 md:space-y-10">
        {/* KnowYourGrape Header (Logo, Title, Subtitle) - ensure good internal spacing and margin-bottom */}
        {/* Selection Cards ("Join", "Host") - ensure good margin-top from header */}
      </motion.div>
    )}

    {userMode === 'join' && (
      <motion.div key="join" className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center flex-grow w-full max-w-xl">
        {/* Join Session Card (Glassmorphism) containing: */}
        {/* - Back Button + "Join Session" Title (well-spaced at top of card) */}
        {/* - Instructional Text */}
        {/* - SessionIdInput (ensure it's well-styled) */}
        {/* - Action Buttons */}
      </motion.div>
    )}

    {userMode === 'host' && (
      <motion.div key="host" className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center flex-grow w-full max-w-xl">
        {/* Host Session Card (Glassmorphism) containing: */}
        {/* - Back Button + "Host Session" Title (well-spaced at top of card) */}
        {/* - Instructional Text */}
        {/* - CodeInput (ensure it's well-styled) */}
        {/* - Action Button */}
      </motion.div>
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>

  {/* Optional: Network status / Sommelier link at bottom, ensure they don't interfere with centering */}
</div>
Using flex-grow on the content an AnimatePresence child that takes up the main space, along with justify-center on that specific child, can help center the active mode's content more consistently, especially if the outer container uses justify-start or has a fixed header/footer area.
Selection Mode Spacing (userMode === 'selection'):
Adjust the mb-12 md:mb-24 on the header section and the space-y-6 md:space-y-8 between the selection cards to create better visual balance and ensure it doesn't feel "glued." Ensure adequate top padding for the entire content area if the main justify-center is too aggressive.
Join/Host Mode Spacing (userMode === 'join' or 'host'):
"Cramped Title": The "Back button + Mode Title" group (e.g., lines 194-204 for 'join') is inside the motion.div but before the main glassmorphism card that holds the inputs. Consider moving this header group inside the glassmorphism card (which has p-6 md:p-8) for a more cohesive unit, or ensure clear separation and good top margin for the card if the title stays outside.
Refine internal padding and space-y-* values within the input cards to ensure inputs, instructional text, and buttons are well-spaced and visually hierarchical. Pay attention to mobile views.
Input Component Styling (CodeInput, SessionIdInput):

Ensure these components (referenced around lines 218 and 270) are styled to fit the premium aesthetic. This includes padding, border, focus states, font size, and color. If they are just wrappers around the standard Input from shadcn/ui, ensure the classes applied achieve a polished look. (The prompt for "bubble style" is deferred, so polish the existing input style).
Typography and Colors:

Re-iterate the need for elegant, mobile-friendly typography. If the AI hasn't already selected specific fonts, prompt it to do so or apply a high-quality default sans-serif consistently.
Encourage tasteful use of the refined color palette (richer purples, optional warm accents for CTAs).
Acceptance Criteria:

Transitions between userMode states in Gateway.tsx are smooth, fast, and free of stutters.
The main "KnowYourGrape" header is only visible in 'selection' mode; it's hidden (and animates out smoothly) when switching to 'join' or 'host' mode.
In 'selection' mode, the header and selection cards have improved vertical spacing and balance.
In 'join' and 'host' modes, the input forms (including their titles and back buttons) are presented as focused, well-centered views with good internal spacing and hierarchy. The "cramped" feeling for titles is resolved.
The overall UI feels more polished, professional, and adheres to mobile-first design principles.
The styling of the CodeInput and SessionIdInput components is clean and fits the premium aesthetic.
