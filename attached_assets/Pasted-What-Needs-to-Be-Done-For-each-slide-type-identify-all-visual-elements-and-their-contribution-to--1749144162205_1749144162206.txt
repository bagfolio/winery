What Needs to Be Done:

For each slide type, identify all visual elements and their contribution to vertical height.
Implement CSS and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS to ensure vertical fit on mobile viewports (e.g., targetting a common small mobile height like ~600-700px as a baseline, minus space for app navigation/status bars).
Ensure solutions are responsive and maintain readability and the established aesthetic.
General Guidance for Replit AI:

Prioritize Vertical Space: Every pixel of vertical space counts. Be aggressive with reducing unnecessary margins and padding where appropriate, but maintain good visual hierarchy.
Responsive Design: While the primary constraint is mobile, ensure layouts don't break on slightly larger screens. Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., sm:, md:) for adjustments if needed, but the "no scroll" rule is paramount for the smallest target screens.
Text Handling: For potentially long text (titles, descriptions, options), ensure effective text wrapping. If text must be truncated to fit, use ellipsis and consider if a "tap to expand" (in a modal, not violating slide scroll) is a fallback, though the preference is for all info to be initially visible.
Styling Consistency: Adhere to the existing theme defined in tailwind.config.ts and variables/styles in client/src/index.css.
Testing: After changes, mentally (or if possible, actually) test layouts on a viewport like 360px width and ~600-670px height.
How to Implement - Component-Specific Adjustments:

Slide Container (client/src/pages/TastingSession.tsx):

The div with class max-w-md mx-auto inside the div with p-6 pb-32 in TastingSession.tsx wraps the output of renderSlideContent.
Action: Ensure this container itself isn't contributing to overflow due to excessive padding, especially pb-32 which is for the fixed bottom navigation. The content within the slide (rendered by renderSlideContent) is the focus here. The main TastingSession div uses min-h-screen, so the content area needs to manage its own height relative to the fixed header and footer.
Interlude Slides (logic within renderSlideContent in client/src/pages/TastingSession.tsx):

Current Key Elements: payload.wine_image (styled w-48 h-72), payload.title (h2), payload.wine_name (h3), payload.description (p). These are within a motion.div with className="text-center space-y-6".
Potential Overflow: Long titles, wine names, or descriptions; the fixed height of the image plus the space-y-6.
Specific Actions for Replit AI:
Reduce space-y-6 if necessary (e.g., to space-y-3 or space-y-4).
Consider slightly smaller font sizes for h2, h3, or p elements specifically on mobile if text length is an issue (e.g., text-2xl md:text-3xl could become text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl).
Ensure the wine_image (w-48 h-72) doesn't dominate too much vertical space. If adjustable, consider max-h-[value] in Tailwind. The current fixed height is 288px.
The surrounding motion.div uses p-8 (padding). This also contributes to overall height. Maybe p-6 on mobile.
Multiple Choice Questions (client/src/components/questions/MultipleChoiceQuestion.tsx):

Current Key Elements: Category badge, question.title (h3), question.description (p), mapped question.options (each with Checkbox, option.text, option.description), and optional Textarea for notes. Outer motion.div has p-8.
Potential Overflow: Long question title/description, numerous options (though 4 is preferred), long option descriptions, visible notes textarea.
Specific Actions for Replit AI:
Reduce outer padding (p-8) to p-6 for mobile.
Reduce space-y-3 between options if necessary.
For each option Label (currently p-4): Reduce padding if needed (e.g., p-3).
Ensure option.description (text-white/60 text-sm) wraps well and doesn't take excessive lines. If a very long option description is unavoidable, this is a tricky spot. The "no scroll" might force truncation here, or very compact font.
The "Task 3: Notes Field as a Dropdown/Collapsible Element" will help significantly here by hiding the textarea. Ensure its trigger and expanded state also fit.
Font sizes for title/description might need mobile-specific adjustments.
Scale Questions (client/src/components/questions/ScaleQuestion.tsx):

Current Key Elements: Category badge, question.title (h3), question.description (p), Slider, slider labels, current value display, and the row of visual scale indicator divs. Outer motion.div has p-8.
Potential Overflow: Long title/description. The visual scale indicators also add some fixed height.
Specific Actions for Replit AI:
Reduce outer padding (p-8) to p-6 for mobile.
Reduce space-y-6 if elements are too far apart.
The div for scale indicators (class="flex justify-between") with h-8 divs inside: if space is extremely tight, the height of these indicators (h-8) could be slightly reduced (e.g., to h-6).
Ensure text for title and description wraps well.
Video Message Slides (logic within renderSlideContent in TastingSession.tsx):

Current Key Elements: Optional title (h2), description (p), video player in a div with aspect-video. Outer motion.div has p-6 md:p-8.
Potential Overflow: Long title/description.
Specific Actions for Replit AI:
Ensure p-6 is used for mobile.
The aspect-video class is good. The max-w-2xl on the video container means its height will be determined by width. On a narrow mobile, this should be manageable.
Focus on keeping the title and description concise or ensure their text wraps within the available space above/below the video without causing overall slide overflow.
Audio Message Slides (logic within renderSlideContent in TastingSession.tsx):

Current Key Elements: Optional title (h2), description (p), native <audio> controls. Outer motion.div has p-6 md:p-8.
Potential Overflow: Long title/description.
Specific Actions for Replit AI:
Similar to video: use p-6 for mobile.
The native audio player has a fairly standard, compact height.
Ensure title and description text wraps well and fits.
Media (Image) Slides (logic within renderSlideContent in TastingSession.tsx):

Current Key Elements: Optional title (h2), img tag with max-w-md mx-auto. Outer motion.div has p-6 md:p-8.
Potential Overflow: Very tall images, or long titles with moderately tall images.
Specific Actions for Replit AI:
Use p-6 for mobile.
For the img tag, while max-w-md controls width, consider adding a max-h-[value] (e.g., max-h-60, max-h-72) to prevent overly tall images from breaking the layout. The image should use object-contain or object-cover as appropriate, along with rounded-lg.
Ensure title text fits.
Replit AI Guidance (Closing Note):
Test each slide type independently after making changes.
Use browser developer tools to simulate different mobile screen heights (e.g., iPhone SE, generic small Android).
The goal is a clean, uncluttered view for each step of the tasting, reinforcing the modern and sleek aesthetic mentioned by the client. If any content truly cannot fit, discuss with the user (me) about potential UX compromises like "tap to view full description" for very specific elements, but only as a last resort.
