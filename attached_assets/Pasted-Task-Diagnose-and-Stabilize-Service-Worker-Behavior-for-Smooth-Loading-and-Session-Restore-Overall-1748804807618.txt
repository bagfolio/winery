Task: Diagnose and Stabilize Service Worker Behavior for Smooth Loading and Session Restore

Overall Goal:
Eliminate long load times and repeated service worker installations on knowyourgrape.replit.app. Ensure users with existing session data are properly prompted to rejoin.

Phase 1: Strict Verification of Previous Critical Fixes

Instruction for AI: Before any new modifications, meticulously verify that the following state is true in the codebase:
In client/public/service-worker.js:
Confirm that the activate event listener does not call indexedDB.deleteDatabase('KnowYourGrapeDB'). The Promise.all([...]) within event.waitUntil(...) for the activate event should only contain the logic for deleting old service worker caches (those starting with CACHE_PREFIX).
In client/src/main.tsx:
Confirm the service worker registration call is exactly: const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js'); (i.e., no timestamp or version query parameter).
Confirm that all previously identified blocks of Chrome-specific aggressive cache-clearing logic have been entirely removed. This includes any calls to caches.keys(), caches.delete(), registration.unregister() that were part of that old cleanup logic.
Phase 2: Implement Diagnostic Logging and Controlled Service Worker Updates

Instruction for AI: Modify client/src/main.tsx to enhance logging and temporarily control the service worker update flow for diagnostic purposes.

Replace the existing service worker registration block within the window.addEventListener('load', async () => { ... }) function with the following more verbose and controlled version:

TypeScript

// New Service Worker Registration Block for client/src/main.tsx
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  try {
    const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');
    console.log('[Main] Service Worker registered. Scope:', registration.scope);

    if (registration.installing) {
      console.log('[Main] Service Worker initially installing:', registration.installing);
    } else if (registration.waiting) {
      console.log('[Main] Service Worker initially waiting:', registration.waiting);
      console.log('[Main] A new service worker is waiting. Automatic SKIP_WAITING is disabled for diagnostics.');
      // To manually trigger update for a waiting SW from DevTools:
      // registration.waiting.postMessage({ type: 'SKIP_WAITING' }); then registration.update() or close & reopen tabs.
    } else if (registration.active) {
      console.log('[Main] Service Worker initially active:', registration.active);
    }

    registration.addEventListener('updatefound', () => {
      console.log('[Main] Service Worker EVENT: updatefound. A new worker is now registration.installing.');
      const newWorker = registration.installing;
      if (newWorker) {
        newWorker.addEventListener('statechange', () => {
          console.log('[Main] New worker EVENT: statechange to:', newWorker.state);
          if (newWorker.state === 'installed') {
            if (navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {
              console.log('[Main] New SW is installed. Current controller exists. Waiting for activation.');
              // A prompt to the user to update could be shown here.
              // Example: if (confirm("New version available. Refresh?")) { registration.waiting.postMessage({ type: 'SKIP_WAITING' }); }
            } else {
              console.log('[Main] New SW installed, and no current controller. It should activate and control on next load/navigation.');
            }
          }
        });
      }
    });

    navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('controllerchange', () => {
      console.log('[Main] Service Worker EVENT: controllerchange! A new Service Worker has taken control.');
      // window.location.reload(); // <<-- Page reload on controllerchange is TEMPORARILY DISABLED for diagnostics
      console.log('[Main] Page reload on controllerchange is currently disabled for diagnostics.');
    });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[Main] Service Worker registration failed:', error);
  }
}
Instruction for AI (Optional but recommended for consistency with the above change): In client/public/service-worker.js:

Comment out or remove the message event listener that handles SKIP_WAITING. The install event in the service worker already calls self.skipWaiting(), which should be sufficient to move an updated worker from "installed" to "waiting" promptly.

JavaScript

// Comment out or remove this block in service-worker.js:
// self.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
//   if (event.data && event.data.type === 'SKIP_WAITING') {
//     self.skipWaiting();
//   }
// });
(Ensure self.skipWaiting(); is still present at the end of the install event listener.)

Explanation of Phase 2 Changes (for the AI and your understanding):

The modified main.tsx code adds detailed logging to track the service worker's state (installing, waiting, active) and events (updatefound, statechange, controllerchange).
Crucially, it temporarily disables the client from automatically sending the SKIP_WAITING message and temporarily disables the automatic window.location.reload() when a new service worker takes control.
This will allow you to observe the service worker's natural lifecycle in the console without the page constantly trying to refresh or the worker being pushed to activate too aggressively by the client.
The goal is to see if the service worker still attempts to "Install version v1.4.0" repeatedly even with these controls in place.
