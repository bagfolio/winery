Reinstate and Refine Participant Progress Update Logic
Context & Why:
When a participant submits a response via POST /api/responses, their progress through the tasting session (tracked by participant.progressPtr) should be updated. This logic seems to have been inadvertently removed or altered in the current version of the POST /api/responses handler in server/routes.ts.

Additionally, the progress should ideally only advance if the participant is answering a new, further slide, not if they are re-submitting an answer for an already passed slide. The "Ultimate Prompt" implied linear progression.

Objective (What):

Reinstate the logic in the POST /api/responses handler in server/routes.ts to update the participant.progressPtr after a response is successfully saved (created or updated).
Refine this logic so that progressPtr is set to the position of the current slide being answered if that position is greater than the participant's current progressPtr.
Implementation Details (How):

Modify POST /api/responses in server/routes.ts (around lines 140-148):
After successfully saving/upserting the response using storage.updateResponse(...):
TypeScript

// ... after const response = await storage.updateResponse(...);
// and res.json(response); (or before res.json if you want to include updated participant in response)

const participant = await storage.getParticipantById(validatedData.participantId);
const currentSlide = await storage.getSlideById(validatedData.slideId);

if (participant && currentSlide) {
  // Only update progress if the current slide's position is further than current progress
  // and ensure progressPtr doesn't exceed total number of slides (if known, otherwise cap later)
  if (currentSlide.position > (participant.progressPtr || 0)) {
    await storage.updateParticipantProgress(
      participant.id,
      currentSlide.position // Set progress to the position of the slide just answered
    );
    console.log(`Updated progress for participant ${participant.id} to slide position ${currentSlide.position}`);
  } else {
    // If re-answering a previous slide, or an out-of-order slide,
    // still update lastActive but don't necessarily rewind progressPtr.
    // The current storage.updateParticipantProgress also updates lastActive.
    // If it doesn't, ensure lastActive is updated here or in storage method.
    await storage.updateParticipantProgress( // This call primarily to update lastActive if not changing progressPtr
        participant.id,
        participant.progressPtr || 0 // Keep current progress if not advancing
    );
     console.log(`Participant ${participant.id} re-answered slide or answered out of order. Progress pointer maintained at ${participant.progressPtr}. Last active updated.`);
  }
}
// The res.json(response) should likely come after these operations if client needs updated participant
// or if these operations are critical to the success of the POST.
// For now, having it before is fine for basic response saving.
Review storage.updateParticipantProgress (in server/storage.ts):
Confirm this method updates both progressPtr and lastActive:
TypeScript

// Current implementation:
// async updateParticipantProgress(participantId: string, progress: number): Promise<void> {
//   await db
//     .update(participants)
//     .set({ 
//       progressPtr: progress,
//       lastActive: new Date() // This is good, updates lastActive
//     })
//     .where(eq(participants.id, participantId));
// }
This is correct as it updates lastActive.
Acceptance Criteria:

When a participant submits a response via POST /api/responses:
The participant.progressPtr in the database is updated to the position of the slideId they just responded to, but only if this slide.position is greater than their current progressPtr.
The participant.lastActive timestamp is updated.
If a participant re-submits an answer to an already completed slide (or a slide with a position less than or equal to their current progressPtr), their progressPtr does not decrease, but their lastActive timestamp should still be updated.
The response saving itself remains functional.
