Overhaul Gateway.tsx UI and User Flow with Distinct Host/Participant Paths & Modern Aesthetics
Context & Why:
The current client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx serves as the application's main entry point but needs a significant UI/UX overhaul to align with the "Ultimate Prompt's" vision for a premium, modern, and engaging wine tasting experience. Key areas for improvement include:

User Flow: The current flow for hosts to initiate a session is not clearly distinguished from participants joining.
Visual Appeal: The page needs a more modern aesthetic, better visual hierarchy, and a more polished feel, especially for mobile users. Inspiration for modernization includes principles like glassmorphism, refined typography, an enhanced color palette, and improved spacing.
Objective (What):
Redesign and reimplement client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx to:

Establish clear, distinct user pathways for "Joining an Existing Tasting Session" and "Hosting a New Tasting Session."
Implement a modern, mobile-first UI with significantly improved visual hierarchy, spacing, and aesthetics, incorporating elements like glassmorphism, elegant typography, and a refined color palette.
Ensure all interactive elements are touch-friendly and the layout is responsive.
Implementation Details (How):

New Gateway Structure - Distinct User Paths:

Overall Layout: Design the page with a strong visual focal point (e.g., a larger, beautifully styled version of the wine glass icon, perhaps animated subtly as suggested in the "Ultimate Prompt's" Gateway example). Use generous spacing.
Two Primary Calls to Action:
A) "Join a Tasting Session" Button/Section:
Clearly labeled for participants.
When activated (e.g., on click or via progressive disclosure), it should present an input field for a Session ID. (Recall: Task 14 updated HostDashboard.tsx to share sessionId links).
Include a button to submit the Session ID, which should then navigate the user to /join?sessionId=[ENTERED_SESSION_ID]. The SessionJoin.tsx page (after Task 15) is designed to handle this.
Consider if the QR scanner option (from the current Gateway.tsx via QRScanner.tsx) should be part of this "Join" flow, now specifically for scanning Session ID QRs (this would require QR codes generated by hosts to contain the Session ID).
B) "Host a New Tasting" Button/Section:
Clearly labeled for hosts.
When activated, this should allow a host to initiate a new session. For an MVP approach:
Present an input field for a Package Code (e.g., "WINE01").
Upon submitting the Package Code (and potentially basic host info like display name if not already captured via useUserProfile), the flow should lead to:
A call to POST /api/sessions to create a new session for that package.
A call to POST /api/sessions/:newSessionId/participants to add the current user as the host participant.
Navigation to /host/:newSessionId/:hostParticipantId.
This effectively moves the "host starts a new session with package code" part of the logic from SessionJoin.tsx to this dedicated host path on the Gateway.
Modern UI Enhancements (Inspired by Claude's suggestions & "Ultimate Prompt"):

Glassmorphism: Apply subtle frosted glass effects to key container elements (e.g., cards/sections for the "Join" and "Host" actions). Use backdrop-filter: blur(Xpx); and semi-transparent backgrounds (e.g., hsl(var(--glass-bg)) or rgba(...)). Refer to CSS variables like --glass-bg, --glass-border defined in client/src/index.css and the "Ultimate Prompt".
Typography:
Select/implement a more elegant primary font (e.g., a sophisticated serif for main headings, a clean sans-serif for body/UI text, or a high-quality modern sans-serif throughout). Ensure it's web-safe or properly imported (e.g., Google Fonts linked in client/index.html and applied in client/src/index.css or Tailwind config).
Establish and apply a clear typographic scale for headings (e.g., text-4xl font-bold for main title), subheadings, and input fields to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
Color Palette Refinement:
Build upon the existing dark purple theme (--gradient-primary).
Introduce richer, deeper purples (e.g., #2d1b4e, #1a0b2e for backgrounds or accents) and potentially subtle warm accent colors (e.g., a muted gold hsl(45, 70%, 60%) or champagne hsl(30, 60%, 85%)) for primary action buttons or highlights. Ensure these fit harmoniously.
Prioritize excellent color contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA).
Micro-interactions (Framer Motion):
Add subtle hover effects (e.g., scale, shadow, gradient shift) and focus states to buttons and input fields.
Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions when revealing input sections or navigating. The animations.ts file can be a source for existing animation definitions.
Spacing & Layout: Generously use padding and margins to give elements "breathing room." Aim for an uncluttered, focused interface.
Mobile-First and Responsive Design:

Design with mobile screens as the primary consideration.
Ensure the layout fluidly adapts to tablet and desktop sizes.
All interactive elements (buttons, input fields) must be easily tappable (minimum 44x44px effective size).
Position primary actions in thumb-friendly zones on mobile.
Functional Enhancements (Initial Considerations for Gateway):

Loading States: If validating a Package Code (for hosts) or a Session ID (for participants) involves an API call directly from the Gateway before navigation, implement clear loading indicators (e.g., using LoadingOverlay.tsx or button loading states).
Error States: Display user-friendly error messages for invalid codes/IDs or network issues.
Files to Modify:

Primarily client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx.
CSS updates may go into client/src/index.css (for global styles, new color variables, font imports) or be handled via Tailwind utility classes directly in the TSX file.
May involve creating new smaller, reusable UI components if the "Join" or "Host" sections become complex.
Logic for creating a session (if moved from SessionJoin.tsx for the host path) will involve using useMutation with apiRequest.
Acceptance Criteria:

Gateway.tsx features a significantly refreshed, modern, and visually appealing UI that is mobile-first and responsive.
The page clearly presents two distinct user paths: "Join a Tasting Session" (requiring a Session ID) and "Host a New Tasting" (starting with a Package Code).
Glassmorphism, improved typography, and a refined color palette are tastefully applied.
Micro-interactions enhance the user experience.
The flow for a host to initiate a session via Package Code is clear and functional, leading them to the Host Dashboard.
The flow for a participant to provide a Session ID is clear and functional, preparing them to join an existing session (the actual joining logic is in SessionJoin.tsx but this page sets it up).
All interactive elements are appropriately sized and positioned for mobile usability.
