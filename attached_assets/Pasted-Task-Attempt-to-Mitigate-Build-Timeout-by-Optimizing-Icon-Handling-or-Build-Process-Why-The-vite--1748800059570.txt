Task: Attempt to Mitigate Build Timeout by Optimizing Icon Handling or Build Process

Why: The vite build process times out in Replit, preventing the creation of essential production JavaScript files. The primary suspect is the processing of the numerous lucide-react icons.

What:

Option A (More Involved but Potentially More Effective): Manually Bundle Used Icons. Instead of relying entirely on Vite's tree-shaking for lucide-react during the build of a large set, create a local "icon library" module within your project that only re-exports the ~50 icons you actually use. Then, change all imports to use this local module. This drastically reduces the number of modules Vite has to look at from lucide-react.
Option B (Simpler to Try, May Not Be Enough): Vite Build Configuration Tweaks. Explore Vite build options that might help with large dependency processing or provide more insight, though Replit's environment limits direct debugging of Vite's internals. (This is less likely to be a complete fix if the issue is raw processing time).
Option C (Alternative Icon Strategy): Consider if an SVG sprite or a web font for icons could be a more performant alternative if optimizing lucide-react imports directly isn't feasible in Replit's build environment. (This is a larger refactor).
How (Focus on Option A as the most promising code-based change for the Replit AI):

Instruct the Replit AI for Option A: Create a Local Icon Module

Create a new file: client/src/components/ui/icons.tsx (or client/src/lib/icons.tsx).

Populate icons.tsx:

"Analyze all import { ... } from 'lucide-react' statements across the entire client/src/ directory to identify every unique icon being used (the assistant mentioned ~50 icons, with HostDashboard.tsx using 13)."
"In the new client/src/components/ui/icons.tsx file, re-export only these used icons. For example:
TypeScript

// client/src/components/ui/icons.tsx
export {
  Users, // From HostDashboard
  Wine,  // From HostDashboard & others
  BarChart3, // From HostDashboard
  Settings,  // From HostDashboard
  QrCode,    // From HostDashboard & JoinSessionView
  Copy,      // From HostDashboard
  Download,  // From HostDashboard
  Play,      // From HostDashboard
  Pause,     // From HostDashboard
  RotateCcw, // From HostDashboard
  Eye,       // From HostDashboard
  Clock,     // From HostDashboard
  TrendingUp, // From HostDashboard
  CheckCircle, // From HostDashboard & TastingSession
  ArrowLeft,  // From Gateway
  ArrowRight, // From TastingSession & SelectionView
  Camera,     // From QRScanner
  X,          // From QRScanner & TastingSession
  AlertCircle, // From QRScanner
  Menu,       // From TastingSession
  BadgeCheck, // From TastingSession
  CloudOff,   // From TastingSession
  UserPlus,   // From SelectionView
  Sparkles,   // From SelectionView
  Home,       // From TastingCompletion & NotFound
  Repeat,     // From TastingCompletion
  Star,       // From TastingCompletion
  Trophy,     // From TastingCompletion
  // ... add ALL other unique icons used in the project
  // Example: ChevronDown from accordion.tsx, select.tsx etc.
  // Example: MoreHorizontal from breadcrumb.tsx, pagination.tsx
  // Example: Dot from input-otp.tsx
} from 'lucide-react';
(Self-note: The assistant will need to perform a thorough search for all icon imports to make this list complete. The above is just a start based on provided component names.)
Update All Icon Imports:

"Modify all files in client/src/ that currently import from 'lucide-react' to now import the necessary icons from the new local module (e.g., import { Users, Wine } from '@/components/ui/icons';)."
Attempt Build Again:

"After these changes, try running the production build command again: npm run build. Observe if it completes without timeout or if the timeout duration changes significantly."
If it still times out, but later: This would suggest the approach is helping but perhaps not enough, or there are other large dependencies.
If it completes: This is the desired outcome. Then, deploy and check if the MIME type error is gone and the app loads.
This approach (Option A) effectively pre-bundles or narrows down the icon set that Vite needs to consider directly from the large lucide-react library, which can significantly improve build times for projects struggling with this specific issue. It's a common optimization strategy.
