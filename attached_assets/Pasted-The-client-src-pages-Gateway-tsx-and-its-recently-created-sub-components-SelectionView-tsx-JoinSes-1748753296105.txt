The client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx and its recently created sub-components (SelectionView.tsx, JoinSessionView.tsx, HostSessionView.tsx) need further refinement to achieve a polished, professional, and highly usable entry point for the application. Current issues include:

Missing Host Name Input: The "Host a New Tasting" flow does not currently allow hosts to enter their display name.
Layout & Spacing:
In the initial 'selection' mode, the main "KnowYourGrape" header can feel too close to the selection cards below it (image_51d5f7.png).
In the 'join' and 'host' modes, when the main header is hidden, the mode-specific titles (e.g., "Join Session") appear "cramped" at the top of their content area, and the overall centering/balance needs improvement (image_51d5bd.png).
Animation Smoothness: The transition when the main "KnowYourGrape" header hides (switching from 'selection' to 'join'/'host' mode) can stutter.
Code Input Style: The CodeInput and SessionIdInput components need to consistently implement the modern "bubble-style" or "character-slot" design (similar to image_6232fd.png) and be fully functional for text input (previously, typing into SessionIdInput was an issue).
Objective (What):
Perform a surgical refinement of Gateway.tsx and its view sub-components to:

Add a "Display Name" input to the host initiation flow and ensure this name is used when creating the host participant.
Correct all identified layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy issues for a balanced, mobile-first, and premium presentation across all modes.
Ensure Framer Motion transitions between views are smooth and fast.
Implement or polish the CodeInput and SessionIdInput components to reliably provide the "bubble-style" input experience and ensure they are fully functional for text entry.
Implementation Details (How):

Part 1: Add Host Display Name Input & Backend Integration

Modify client/src/components/gateway/HostSessionView.tsx:
Add a new props to its interface: hostDisplayName: string;, setHostDisplayName: (name: string) => void;.
Add a new, required <Input /> field for "Your Display Name" (styled consistently with other inputs on the page). This input should be bound to the hostDisplayName prop and update it via setHostDisplayName.
This field should appear before the CodeInput for the package code.
Update client/src/pages/Gateway.tsx:
Add new state: const [hostDisplayName, setHostDisplayName] = useState('');.
Pass hostDisplayName and setHostDisplayName as props to <HostSessionView />.
Modify handleHostSession: Add a check to ensure hostDisplayName.trim() is not empty before calling createSessionMutation.mutate.
Modify createSessionMutation's mutationFn (around line 23):
It currently sends a hardcoded hostName: 'Host'. Change this to send the actual hostDisplayName from the state:
TypeScript

const sessionResponse = await apiRequest("POST", "/api/sessions", {
  packageCode,
  hostDisplayName: hostDisplayName.trim() || 'Host', // Use entered name, fallback if somehow empty
  createHost: true, 
});
In handleBack function, also reset setHostDisplayName('');.
Verify Backend POST /api/sessions in server/routes.ts (lines 55-103):
Ensure it correctly uses req.body.hostDisplayName when creating the host participant record. The current backend logic displayName: hostDisplayName || hostName || 'Host' should already handle this if hostDisplayName is sent.
Part 2: Layout, Spacing, and Animation Smoothness in Gateway.tsx & Sub-Views

Smooth Header Transition (Main KYG Header Hiding/Showing):
Review the <AnimatePresence> block (around line 105 in Gateway.tsx) and the motion.div for SelectionView (which contains the main KYG header).
Ensure its exit animation (opacity: 0, y: -30) and the initial animations of JoinSessionView / HostSessionView (e.g., opacity: 0, y: 40, scale: 0.98) are coordinated to prevent stutter.
Simplify transition props (duration, ease) if necessary or investigate if background animations are interfering. Consider making the background animations pause or have reduced motion during view transitions if they are resource-intensive.
Spacing in SelectionView.tsx (or its equivalent logic if still in Gateway.tsx):
The "KnowYourGrape" main header section within SelectionView should have more margin-bottom (e.g., mb-16 md:mb-20 or even more) to create clear separation from the "Join Session" and "Host Session" cards below it, addressing the "glued" feeling from image_51d5f7.png.
The SelectionView's root motion.div (which is w-full) should use flexbox to center its content (header + two cards) pleasingly on the screen, ensuring adequate padding from the top when justify-start is used on the main page container. For example, add flex flex-col items-center justify-center flex-grow to this motion.div if it's meant to fill space.
Layout and Title Spacing in JoinSessionView.tsx and HostSessionView.tsx:
For these focused views (when the main KYG header is hidden):
The "Back" button and the mode-specific title (e.g., "Join Session" H2) should form a distinct header within these views.
Move this header group (Back button + Title + Subtitle) out of the main glassmorphism card that contains the inputs. Place it above the card, with clear margin-bottom (e.g., mb-6 or mb-8) before the card begins. This addresses the "cramped title" issue.
Ensure the glassmorphism card containing the inputs and action buttons has balanced internal padding (e.g., p-8 md:p-10 as seen in HostSessionView.tsx) and good space-y-* for its content.
The parent motion.div in Gateway.tsx for these views already uses flex flex-col items-center justify-center flex-grow, which should center the view well.
Part 3: Implement/Polish "Bubble-Style" Code Input Components

Target Components: client/src/components/CodeInput.tsx and client/src/components/SessionIdInput.tsx (as imported in Gateway.tsx).
Functionality:
Ensure these components are fully functional for text input, including typing, backspace/delete, and pasting (if appropriate). The previous issue where typing didn't work in SessionIdInput must be resolved.
They must correctly use their value, onChange, maxLength, and onComplete props.
Visual Style (Achieve image_6232fd.png look and "Ultimate Prompt" F-1 CodeInput concept):
Visually render as a series of distinct character slots/boxes/bubbles.
Each slot should display one character of the input value.
Use a clear, monospaced font within the slots.
Slots should have distinct styling for empty, active/focused, and filled states (e.g., changing border color, background, or character color).
Implement the small indicator dots below the input (one dot per maxLength, visually filled as the user types).
Ensure styling is consistent with the app's premium dark theme and glassmorphism elements.
Ensure they are mobile-friendly with adequate touch targets for interaction (even if it's a single underlying hidden input).
Integrate triggerHaptic('selection') on input change.
Acceptance Criteria:

Host Flow: Hosts can now enter their Display Name on the Gateway.tsx ("Host Session" view), and this name is used when their participant record is created on the backend.
Layout & Spacing:
The main "KnowYourGrape" header in 'selection' mode has sufficient space above the selection cards.
In 'join' and 'host' modes, the main KYG header is hidden, and the view-specific title (e.g., "Join Session") is well-spaced above its input card, resolving the "cramped" feel.
All views ('selection', 'join', 'host') appear visually balanced and well-centered, especially on mobile.
