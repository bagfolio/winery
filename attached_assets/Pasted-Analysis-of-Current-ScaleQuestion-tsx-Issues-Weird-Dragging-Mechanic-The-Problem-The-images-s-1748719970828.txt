Analysis of Current ScaleQuestion.tsx Issues:

"Weird" Dragging Mechanic:

The Problem: The images show the thumb (the draggable circle) being moved freely within the SVG's bounding box, not strictly along the circular path. This is because dragConstraints={svgRef} on the thumb's <motion.circle> allows it to be dragged anywhere within the parent SVG.
How it should feel: The user should feel like they are either dragging the thumb along the circular track or that their interaction with the track area directly sets the thumb's position on that track. The thumb shouldn't appear to detach from the track during a drag.
Current Logic: The handleDrag function calculates an angle based on the pointer's position relative to the SVG's center and then updates localValue. The thumb's cx and cy are then re-calculated based on this localValue. While logically this should snap the thumb back to the circle on re-render, the visual effect during an active drag can be that the thumb temporarily moves off-path before snapping, leading to the "weird" feeling.
Fill Animation Accuracy ("not 100% at 10 and will begin like moving shorter"):

The Problem: The progress arc might not be visually starting/ending at the correct points of the 270-degree sweep, or not fully representing the min/max values.
Potential Causes:
strokeDashoffset Calculation: The line const strokeDashoffset = circumference * (1 - progress * 0.75); combined with the transform="rotate(-135 ${centerX} ${centerY})" is intended to show a 270-degree arc (which is 75% of a full circle).
When progress = 0 (min value), strokeDashoffset = circumference (correctly shows nothing of the arc if strokeDasharray is also circumference).
When progress = 1 (max value), strokeDashoffset = circumference * (1 - 0.75) = circumference * 0.25. This correctly leaves 0.25 of the circumference "hidden," thus showing 0.75 (or 270 degrees) of the arc.
The math here seems mostly right for the arc length. The issue could be in:
How the gradient (url(#gradient)) interacts with the strokeDashoffset and rotation.
The strokeLinecap="round" can sometimes make the visual start/end points slightly different than the mathematical ones.
The exact starting angle of the visual path of the circle being animated vs. the -135 degree rotation.
Visuals ("looks terrible," "literally just shapes"):

The current SVG seems to implement the track and thumb. If you were hoping for a more literal "wine glass" shape that fills, the current SVG isn't designed for that. The prompt was for a "circular slider," which is often more of a gauge/dial.
To make the current circular slider more "beautiful":
Ensure the strokeWidth and progressStrokeWidth are balanced.
The glow filter is a good start.
Colors from the theme (hsl(var(--primary)), hsl(var(--muted) / 0.3)) are used, which is good for consistency.
The thumb has a thumbGradient.
Redundant Value Indicators ("bar at the bottom"):

The row of animating bars below the circular slider (lines 242-276) is an addition by the AI that wasn't in the "Ultimate Prompt's" circular slider example. If the circular slider itself clearly indicates the value (which it should, with the arc and central text), these bars are likely redundant and add clutter.
Conditional Animation / Toggling:

Your idea of toggling animations or having them vary by context is a good one for future enhancements but adds complexity now. For the MVP, getting one elegant and functional version of the circular slider is key.
Server-Side Fix Verification:
The Replit AI's fix to shared/schema.ts making participantId and slideId required in insertResponseSchema and updating server/routes.ts is correct and crucial.
