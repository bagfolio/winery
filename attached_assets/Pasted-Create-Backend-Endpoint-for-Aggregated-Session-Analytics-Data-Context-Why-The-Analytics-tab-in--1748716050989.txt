Create Backend Endpoint for Aggregated Session Analytics Data
Context & Why:
The "Analytics" tab in client/src/pages/HostDashboard.tsx currently displays placeholder or very basic statistics (e.g., hardcoded session times, total question slides instead of answered questions). To provide meaningful insights to the host, we need a backend endpoint that can process all participant responses for a given session and return aggregated analytics. This includes summaries for multiple-choice questions (e.g., how many picked each option) and scale questions (e.g., average scores).

The "Ultimate Prompt" envisioned rich host analytics, and this endpoint is the foundation for that. Currently, the HostDashboard.tsx attempts to fetch raw responses via a disabled query queryKey: [\/api/sessions/${sessionId}/responses`]`, but an endpoint that provides aggregated data would be far more efficient and useful.

Objective (What):
Implement a new API endpoint in server/routes.ts (e.g., /api/sessions/:sessionId/analytics) that calculates and returns aggregated analytics for a specific session. This involves creating data processing logic, likely within server/storage.ts (the DatabaseStorage class).

Implementation Details (How):

Define Data Aggregation Logic (in server/storage.ts or a new service file like server/analyticsService.ts):
Create a new public method in the DatabaseStorage class (or a dedicated analytics service class/module) named, for example, async getAggregatedSessionAnalytics(sessionId: string).
This method should perform the following database queries using Drizzle ORM:
Fetch the specified Session details using sessionId (to confirm existence and get packageId).
Fetch all Participants for this sessionId to get totalParticipants and calculate how many have progressPtr equal to or greater than the number of answerable slides (for completedParticipants).
Fetch all Slides for the session's packageId.
Fetch all Responses for this sessionId.
Process and Aggregate Data:
Calculate overall session stats: totalParticipants, completedParticipants, averageProgressPercent (based on progressPtr of all participants vs. total slides).
For each slide of type: 'question':
Determine its question_type from slide.payloadJson (e.g., 'multiple_choice', 'scale').
Filter all responses from the session that correspond to this slideId.
For 'multiple_choice' / 'single_choice' questions:
Aggregate how many times each option (from slide.payloadJson.options) was selected. The answerJson in the responses table will likely contain an array of selected option IDs or the single selected ID.
Count how many participants submitted notes if slide.payloadJson.allow_notes was true.
For 'scale' questions:
Calculate the average, minimum, and maximum score from answerJson.
Optionally, create a distribution of scores (e.g., how many participants selected '1', '2', ... '10').
Create the API Endpoint in server/routes.ts:
Add a new route: app.get('/api/sessions/:sessionId/analytics', async (req, res) => { ... });
Inside this route handler:
Call the new aggregation method (e.g., const analyticsData = await storage.getAggregatedSessionAnalytics(req.params.sessionId);).
If analyticsData is successfully retrieved, send it as a JSON response.
Implement error handling (e.g., if the session is not found, return a 404; for other errors, return a 500).
Define the Structure of the JSON Response:
The response should be well-structured for easy consumption by the frontend. Example:
JSON

{
  "sessionId": "session-uuid",
  "sessionName": "Actual Session Name", // Fetch if available
  "packageName": "Actual Package Name", // Fetch if available
  "totalParticipants": 12,
  "completedParticipants": 8,
  "averageProgressPercent": 70,
  "slidesAnalytics": [
    {
      "slideId": "slide-uuid-1",
      "slidePosition": 1,
      "slideTitle": "What aromas do you detect?", // from slide.payloadJson.title
      "slideType": "question", 
      "questionType": "multiple_choice", // from slide.payloadJson.question_type
      "aggregatedData": {
        "optionsSummary": [
          { "optionId": "1", "optionText": "Dark fruits...", "count": 9, "percentage": 75 },
          // ... other options
        ],
        "notesSubmittedCount": 4 
      }
    },
    {
      "slideId": "slide-uuid-2",
      // ... other common slide fields
      "questionType": "scale",
      "aggregatedData": {
        "averageScore": 7.2,
        "minScore": 5,
        "maxScore": 10,
        "scoreDistribution": { "5": 2, "6": 1, "7": 3, "8": 3, "9": 2, "10": 1 } 
      }
    }
    // ... etc. for all question slides
  ]
}
Acceptance Criteria:

A new GET API endpoint, /api/sessions/:sessionId/analytics, is implemented in server/routes.ts.
This endpoint queries the database (via methods in server/storage.ts) to gather all necessary session, participant, slide, and response data.
It correctly aggregates response data for each question slide based on its question_type (e.g., counts for multiple-choice options, averages/distributions for scale questions).
The endpoint returns a structured JSON object containing overall session statistics and per-slide aggregated analytics.
Appropriate error handling is in place (e.g., for invalid sessionId).
The calculations for analytics are accurate based on the stored data.
