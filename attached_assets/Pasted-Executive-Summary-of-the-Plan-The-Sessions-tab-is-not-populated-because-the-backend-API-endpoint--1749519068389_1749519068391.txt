Executive Summary of the Plan
The "Sessions" tab is not populated because the backend API endpoint (/api/sessions) currently sends a list of sessions without joining it with the packages table. This means crucial information like the Package Name is missing.
Our plan involves three main steps:
Enhance the Backend: Modify the database query to include package details for each session.
Update the Dashboard UI: Adjust the frontend code in SommelierDashboard.tsx to display this new, complete information.
Correct the QR Code Modal: Ensure the QRCodeModal component also receives and displays the accurate package name.
Step 1: Enhance the Backend API (The Core Fix)
The root of the problem lies in server/storage.ts. The getAllSessions function only queries the sessions table. We need to modify it to join with the packages table to retrieve the package name.
File to Edit: server/storage.ts
Action:
Modify the getAllSessions method to perform a leftJoin and include the package name in the result.
// server/storage.ts

// ... other code

  async getAllSessions(): Promise<Session[]> {
    // This is the new, enhanced query.
    const result = await db
      .select({
        id: sessions.id,
        packageId: sessions.packageId,
        short_code: sessions.shortCode,
        status: sessions.status,
        startedAt: sessions.startedAt,
        completedAt: sessions.completedAt,
        activeParticipants: sessions.activeParticipants,
        updatedAt: sessions.updatedAt,
        // We add the package name and code directly to the session object
        packageName: packages.name, 
        packageCode: packages.code,
      })
      .from(sessions)
      .leftJoin(packages, eq(sessions.packageId, packages.id))
      .orderBy(desc(sessions.createdAt)); // Order by most recent

    // The 'as any' is a practical type assertion because Drizzle's return type
    // from a join can be complex. We are confident in the structure we've selected.
    return result as any;
  }

// ... other code
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
What this change does:
It modifies the database query to fetch not just session data, but also the name and code from the associated package.
It renames packages.name to packageName for clarity on the frontend.
It orders the sessions by creation date, so the newest ones appear first, which is a better user experience.
Step 2: Update the Sommelier Dashboard Frontend
Now that the backend provides the necessary data, we'll update the SommelierDashboard.tsx component to use it.
File to Edit: client/src/pages/SommelierDashboard.tsx
Actions:
Update the Session interface to include the new packageName field. This gives you proper TypeScript type-safety.
// client/src/pages/SommelierDashboard.tsx (around line 138)

interface Session {
  id: string;
  packageCode: string;
  packageName: string; // <-- Add this line
  code: string;
  participantCount: number;
  status: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Modify the rendering logic within the session card to display the packageName instead of the packageCode. We'll keep the code as a fallback.
// client/src/pages/SommelierDashboard.tsx (around line 745)

<div className="space-y-2 text-sm text-white/70 mb-4">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    <span>Package:</span>
    <span className="text-white font-medium"> {/* <-- Changed from text-white */}
      {session.packageName || session.packageCode} {/* <-- Use packageName */}
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    <span>Participants:</span>
    <span className="text-white">
      {session.participantCount}
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    <span>Created:</span>
    <span className="text-white">
      {new Date(session.createdAt).toLocaleDateString()}
    </span>
  </div>
</div>
Use code with caution.

Step 3: Correct the QR Code Modal Display
Finally, let's ensure the pop-up QR code modal also displays the correct information.
File to Edit: client/src/components/QRCodeModal.tsx
Actions:
Update the QRCodeModalProps interface to expect the packageName.
// client/src/components/QRCodeModal.tsx (around line 12)

interface QRCodeModalProps {
  session: {
    id: string;
    packageCode: string;
    packageName?: string; // <-- Add this optional field
    code: string;
    status: string;
    participantCount: number;
    createdAt: string;
  };
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
}
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Update the JSX to display the packageName.
// client/src/components/QRCodeModal.tsx (around line 149)

<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <span className="text-gray-400 text-sm">Package</span>
  <span className="text-white text-sm font-medium">
    {session.packageName || session.packageCode || 'Wine Package'} {/* <-- Use packageName */}
  </span>
</div>
Use code with caution.

Conclusion
By making these three targeted changes, you will have a fully functional and data-accurate "Sessions" tab.
The backend will provide all the necessary data in a single, efficient API call.
The dashboard will correctly display the list of live/completed sessions with their package name, participant count, and creation date.
The QR Code modal will pop up with accurate, session-specific information.
This approach resolves the issues you described and sets a solid foundation for any future enhancements to the Sommelier Dashboard. Let me know if you have any other questions
